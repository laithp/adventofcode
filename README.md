# adventofcode
Putting my entries for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge here.

I will be attempting to work the 2024 AoC directly during December, I am also going to begin working through some of the prior years. As these are intended to be quickly executed challenges I will be mostly focusing on writing a valid solution, not necessarily the most fully formed and production best practices version of a solution.

- 2023
  - Challenges 1-2 completed in PHP.
- 2024
  - Pending challenge release 12/1
